## Open Questions

1. How do we rename thing going from one version to the next?

## Missing Features

1. Canary support in ExtendedStatefulSets

## High-level Direction

- releases are defined in the usual way (a `releases` block), but the information given is used to build a reference for a docker image
- each instance group is transformed to an `ExtendedStatefulSet` or an `ExtendedJob`
- each BOSH Job corresponds to one or more containers in the `Pod` template defined in the `ExtendedStatefulSet` or the `ExtendedJob`; there's one container for each process defined in the BPM information of each BOSH Job
- "explicit" `variables` are generated using `ExtendedSecrets`
- for rendering of BOSH Job Templates, please read [this document](rendering_templates.md)
- we have a concept of [Desired Manifests](desired_manifests.md)
- all communication happens through Kubernetes `Services`, which have deterministic DNS Addresses; you can read more about these [here](rendering_templates.md#services-and-dns-addresses)

## Deployment Lifecycle

Please read the [documentation for the `BOSHDeployment` controller](controllers/boshdeployment.md).

## BPM

In a BOSH release some jobs have BPM configuration in `templates/bpm.yml.erb`. Each process specified in the BPM configuration is run in a single Kubernetes `Container` as part of a `Pod`.

The following subsections describe the mapping of BPM configuration into containers.

### Entrypoint & Environment Variables

| Bosh         | Kube Pod Container |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `executable` | `command`          |
| `args`       | `args`             |
| `env`        | `env`              |

### Resources

| Bosh                          | Kube Pod Container                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workdir`                     | `workingDir`. Not implemented yet.                             |
| `hooks`                       | `initContainers`. and container hooks. Not implemented yet.    |
| `process.capabilities`        | `container.SecurityContext.Capabilities`.                      |
| `limits`                      | `container.Resources.Limits`. Not implemented yet.             |
| `ephemeral_disk`              | `emptyDir`. volumes.                                           |
| `persistent_disk`             | `PersistentVolumeClaims`. Not yet implemented.                 |
| `additional_volumes`          | `emptyDir`. Paths under /var/vcap/store are currently ignored. |
| `unsafe.unrestricted_volumes` | `emptyDir`. Paths under /var/vcap/store are currently ignored. |
| `unsafe.privileged`           | `container.SecurityContext.Privileged`.                        |

### Health checks

BPM doesn't provide information for health checks and relies on monit instead.
CF-Operator provides health checks via the [bosh_containerization](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/blob/master/pkg/bosh/manifest/containerization.go#L11) property key in the deployment manifest.

In Kubernetes, we use [liveness and readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/) for healthchecks.

### Hooks

BPM supports `pre_start` hooks. CF-Operator will convert those to additional init containers.

## Conversion Details

### Calculation of docker image location for releases

Release image tags are immutable.
The release image locations are comprised of multiple elements:

- docker registry URL
- organization and repository
- stemcell name and version
- fissile version
- the release name and version

Release image locations always have to be resolved in the context of an instance group/job because they depend on the stemcell that is being used.

A typical release image location looks could look like `hub.docker.com/cfcontainerization/cflinuxfs3-release:opensuse-15.0-28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_233.gde0accd0-0.62.0`.

The different elements are taken from different places in the manifest. Given this excerpt from a BOSH deployment manifest:

```yaml
stemcells:
- alias: default
  os: opensuse-42.3
  version: 28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_234.gcd7d1132
instance_groups:
- name: diego-cell
  stemcell: default
  jobs:
  - name: cflinuxfs3-rootfs-setup
    release: cflinuxfs3
releases:
- name: cflinuxfs3
  version: 0.62.0
  url: hub.docker.com/cfcontainerization
  sha1: 6466c44827c3493645ca34b084e7c21de23272b4
  stemcell:
    os: opensuse-15.0
    version: 28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_233.gde0accd0
```

The stemcell information (name, and stemcell and fissile version) are taken from the `stemcells` entry that matches the instance group's stemcell alias. The registry URL including the organization, the release name, and the version com from the `releases` entry that's referenced from the job.

> **Note:**
>
> Releases can optionally specify a separate `stemcell` section, in which case the information from the instance group stemcell is overridden.

### Variables to Extended Secrets

For each **Explicit BOSH Variable** (with a definition in the `variables` section in the deployment manifest), the cf-operator creates an `ExtendedSecret`.
The `ExtendedSecret` is meant to generate the value required by the variable.

The name of the `ExtendedSecret` is calculated like this:

```text
<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>.var-<VARIABLE_NAME>
```

The name of the final generated `Secret` (the `secretName` key of the `ExtendedSecret`) is calculated the same way.

### Instance Groups to Extended StatefulSets and Jobs

#### BOSH Services vs BOSH Errands

BOSH Services are converted to `ExtendedStatefulSets` and `Services`.

BOSH Errands are converted to `ExtendedJobs` with `trigger.strategy: manually`.

BOSH Auto-Errands (supported only by the operator) are converted to `ExtendedJobs` with `trigger.strategy: once`.

## Miscellaneous

### Dealing with AZs

`ExtendedStatefulSets` support AZs. You can learn more about this in [the docs](controllers/extendedstatefulset.md#az-support).

### Support for active/passive pod replicas

TODO - Not implemented yet.

### Ephemeral Disks

We use an `emptyDir` for ephemeral disks. You can learn more from [the official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).

### Credentials for Docker Registries

Providing credentials for private registries is supported by Kubernetes. Please read [the official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials).

### Running manual errands

BOSH makes use of errands, which are manually triggered.
We support manual triggers - you can learn more in the [ExtendedJob docs](controllers/extendedjob.md#errand-jobs).

### Readiness and Liveness Probes

When the deployment manifest declares health check information for jobs, via the `bosh_containerization` section, we configure those in Kubernetes.

The probes are defined per BPM process.

**Example:**

```yaml
instance_groups:
- name: "api-az1"
  process.
    properties:
      bosh_containerization:
        run:
          healthcheck:
            bpm-process-name:
              readiness:
              liveness:
```

Both keys contain information that should is used as-is for the container that matches the process name.

### Persistent Disks

When a BOSH deployment manifest declares persistent disks on instance groups, we provide a persistent volume to the containers of a pod in `/var/vcap/store`. You can learn more about BOSH Persistent Disks in the [BOSH Official Docs](https://bosh.io/docs/persistent-disks/).

These volumes are mounted on each container that's part of the instance group.

The implementation uses the default storage class if not specified using the `persistent_disk_type` key in the manifest.

### Manual ("implicit") variables

BOSH deployment manifests support two different types of variables, implicit and explicit ones.

"Explicit" variables are declared in the `variables` section of the manifest and are generated automatically before the interpolation step.

"Implicit" variables just appear in the document within double parentheses without any declaration. These variables have to be provided by the user prior to creating the BOSH deployment. The variables have to be provided as a secret with the `value` key holding the variable content. The secret name has to follow the scheme

```text
<deployment-name>.var-<variable-name>
```

Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nats-deployment.var-system-domain
type: Opaque
stringData:
  value: example.com
```

## Flow

## Naming Conventions

After creating a `BOSHDeployment` named `nats-deployment`, with one Instance Group, the following resources should exist:

- `BOSHDeployment`

  ```text
  nats-deployment
  ```

- `ExtendedJob`

  ```text
  bpm-configs-nats-deployment
  data-gathering-nats-deployment
  var-interpolation-nats-deployment
  ```

- `ExtendedSecret`

  ```text
  nats-deployment.var-nats-password
  ```

- `ExtendedStatefulSet`

  ```text
  nats-deployment-nats
  ```

- `Secrets`

  ```text
  nats-deployment.bpm.nats-v1
  nats-deployment.ig-resolved.nats-v1
  nats-deployment.var-nats-password
  nats-deployment.with-ops
  nats-deployment.desired-manifest-v1
  ```

- `StatefulSets`

  ```text
  nats-deployment-nats-v1
  ```

- `Pods`

  ```text
  nats-deployment-nats-v1-0
  nats-deployment-nats-v1-1
  ```

- `Services`

  ```text
  nats-deployment-nats
  nats-deployment-nats-0
  nats-deployment-nats-1
  ```
